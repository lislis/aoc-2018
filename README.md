# Advent of code solutions 2018

in Rust!

## Run the things

Install the Rust toolchain https://beta.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

Then run in the individual day folder ```$ cargo run```.

Some of the examples are quite heavy, I'd recommend building them in release mode first

```$ cargo build --release```
